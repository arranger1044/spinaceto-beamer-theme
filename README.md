# Spinaceto Beamer Theme

Spinaceto is the new work-in-progress beamer theme that I am using for my slides and presentations.

It is an evolution from my previous beamer theme, [**_Enziteto_**](https://github.com/arranger1044/enzitetobeamertheme).

As Enziteto, Spinaceto is designed to provide a minimalistic theme in which
the information hierarchy is rendered mainly through typographic features.
Differently from Enziteto, important information pieces in the hierarchy are highlighted by color (boxes).

## Requirements
In order to use `spinaceto` for your beamer presentations, you will need:

- [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) as a
  decent open source sans serif font
- [XeLaTeX](http://www.xelatex.org/) to compile LaTeX sources with
custom fonts

## Install
Run `make install` and then `make reload` (this last command may need
admin privileges) to copy the `.sty` files to your tex-mf dir.

## Examples
To compile the examples of this repo into pdfs, `cd` into the examples dir and run `make`.

More examples of my slides using `spinaceto` can be found [here](https://github.com/arranger1044/aaai19-abda-presgari/blob/master/presgari.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/arranger1044/antitesi-presgari/blob/master/presgari.pdf).

## Why Spinaceto
Traditionally, beamer themes are named after cities.

[*Enziteto*](https://github.com/arranger1044/enzitetobeamertheme) is the name of a small town with a bad reputation in the municipality of Bari, my hometown. 

[*Spinaceto*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mACBDz6vBpI) is another small town in the municipality of Rome, being known for the same bad reasons.
